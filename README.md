# StarScape

Welcome! This is a project that is heavily inspired by Space Station 13. I've played SS13 for years, and while it's an excellent game with excellent depth, I feel it needs some reworking. SS13 is still based on the Byond platform which, while clearly good enough for SS13, has some serious issues I won't go into. With that in mind, this is not meant to be a replacement to SS13, but rather a game with a similar style in mind. This is a MonoGame project built in C#. If you'd like to use my code for you're own project, feel free! I'm just here for some fun.

Also, I'm going to be honest, I don't have much experience with working github and other people. If you feel like I should add something or just have questions in general, feel free to send me a message!

## General Roadmap

This is a living roadmap that is subject to change (primarily as the game gets more in-depth):

1. Generate ships that are *mostly* self-sufficient:
    1. Atmospherics
        1. Air pressure and working air system that goes throught the ship using
        2. Machines that regulate the air
        3. Pipes that can interconnect different parts of the ship.
    2. Power
        1. Power should be provided by some means of generation
        2. Power should be transported via cables
        3. Closed circuits are not needed
    3. Thrust
        1. Ships should have thrusters that allow them to maneuver around. This does not need to be a full fledged system with thrusters needing to be placed in certain directions, hell, it could simply be some machinery that moves the ship through woo-woo waves.

2. Have players that can operate the ship
    1. Different roles have different access levels in the ship
    2. Operations of the ship that aren't self-sufficient must be completed by the players

3. Get different ships to be able to interact
    1. Ships should be able to dock to each other, given the appropriate requirements
