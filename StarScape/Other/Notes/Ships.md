General Roadmap:
1. Generate ships that are *mostly* self-sufficient:
    A. Atmospherics
        I.   Air pressure and working air system that goes throught the ship using
        II.  Machines that regulate the air
    B. Power
        I.   Power should be provided by some means of generation
        II.  Power should be transported via cables
        III. Closed circuits are not needed
    C. Thrust
        I.   Ships should have thrusters that allow them to maneuver around. This does not need to be a full fledged system with thrusters needing to be placed in certain directions,
                hell, it could simply be some machinery that moves the ship through woo-woo waves.

2. Have players that can operate the ship
    A. Different roles have different access levels in the ship
    B. Operations of the ship that aren't self-sufficient must be completed by the players

3. Get different ships to be able to interact
    A. Ships should be able to dock to each other, given the appropriate requirements
